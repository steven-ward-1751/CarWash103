<div id="q1" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">How does the car wash know I am getting the correct wash?</h4>
    <p>When you purchase your car wash, the computer outside sends the information to the computer inside. Once your gate goes up it puts your wash in the queue. A lighted sign at the entrance will show your wash just before you enter the carwash tunnel.</p>
</div>
    
<div id="q2" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">Do I stay inside my car?</h4>
    <p>Yes! Our conveyor system allows you to stay inside your vehicle throughout the entire process. When you pull onto the lot, you will be greeted by our friendly staff who will assist you with your wash selection at the Auto Cashier so you never have to leave your driver’s seat.</p>
</div>
    
<div id="q3" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">Do you provide any interior detailing?</h4>
    <p>No, we are an express, exterior-only car wash. We have found that this particular type of car wash model allows us to provide our customers with a fast, high quality wash every time.</p>
</div>
    
<div id="q4" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">Do you take credit cards?</h4>
    <p>Yes! We accept MasterCard and Visa as well as cash and prepurchased Car Wash 103 gift cards.</p>
</div>
    
<div id="q5" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">How often should I wash my vehicle?</h4>
    <p>Wash frequency depends on the climate and environment that you live. In Missouri and Kansas, it is important to wash weekly to remove pollutants in the rain, bugs, salt and mud.</p>
</div>
    
<div id="q6" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">Is car washing environmentally friendly?</h4>
    <p>Yes, washing your car in a professional car wash is the best way to conserve water and protect the environment. By using state-of-the-art equipment and design practices, Car Wash 103 reclaims and recycles the water used in the wash process. This results in significant water savings over traditional commercial car washes or hand washing. Washing your car in the driveway also causes the water to go into the storm drain. This drain is only meant for rainwater. The soapy wash water ends up in our rivers and lakes killing fish and polluting the environment. Car Wash 103 uses earth-friendly cleaning solutions. Our detergents are biodegradable and contain no phosphates or caustic solutions. At Car Wash 103, the dirt that comes off your car ends up as cover at landfills and recycled for use at asphalt plants.</p>

<div id="q7" class="container-fluid bg-blue">
    <h4 class="text-center">Are there any vehicles you can’t wash?</h4>
    <p>Because we are in the car care business, we want to wash any and all vehicles that come to the facility; however, because of our commitment to maintain a safe environment and provide the highest quality wash available, we do have some restrictions. It is a challenge to meet these commitments given the large variety of vehicle dimensions, shapes, and sizes. To ensure the safety of our customers’ vehicles, and to deliver the level of quality we promise, we do place some specific restrictions on the vehicles we wash.</p>
    <p>We cannot wash: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Full-size and extended top vans</li>
        <li>All Hummers</li>
        <li>Trucks with dual rear tires</li>
        <li>Open bed pickup trucks with fuel tanks, any loose items, and debris</li>
        <li>Vehicles with tripod-style mirrors</li>
        <li>Trucks or vans with ladders or ladder racks</li>
        <li>Vehicles that sit too low to the ground</li>
